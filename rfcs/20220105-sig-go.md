## Objective

Establish SIG Go with the objectives of fostering and facilitating community
collaboration around the TensorFlow Go bindings.  Community collaboration is
expected to result in improvements to the usability and maintenance of the
bindings.

## Context

Go is a statically-typed, compiled programming language with wide use,
especially in the development of API/RPC services, CLIs and web services and in
data processing [[1](https://blog.golang.org/survey2020-result)].  Go bindings
to the TensorFlow C API were first introduced in TensorFlow v0.11.0 and have
since resided within the main TensorFlow repository, at
[github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/go](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/tree/r2.8/tensorflow/go).
These bindings are
[loosely integrated with the build system](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/50934)
and are presently listed as being both
[unsupported by the community](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions) and
[unsupported by the TensorFlow team](https://github.com/tensorflow/build/tree/master/golang_install_guide).

Significant problems presently exist in the usability of TensorFlow's Go
bindings.  Changes to how Go manages dependencies, specifically in the
implementation of [Go Modules](https://blog.golang.org/using-go-modules), have
resulted in a set of installation challenges (see, for instance, GitHub issues
[41808](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/41808) and
[43847](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/43847)). To alleviate
these issues, there has been discussion regarding relocation of the Go bindings
to a dedicated repository
([1](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/44655#issuecomment-725040183),
[2](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/50934)).  A component of this
SIG proposal is a request for TensorFlow team support and collaboration in
migrating the TensorFlow Go bindings to a dedicated GitHub repository.

This request proposes that an opportunity exists to establish a effective SIG
around the Go bindings. In the past, the TensorFlow developer community has
made valuable contributions to the Go bindings, but community contributions
have been sporadic. Implicit in this request is an acknowledgment that the
current approach is unlikely to fully promote community collaboration due, for
instance, to collocation of the bindings with TensorFlow core, methods for
issue assignment/handling, the current state of the bindings in terms of
usability, and the recent shift of the bindings into unsupported status.  The
expected outcome of establishing SIG Go is to increase community collaboration
around the Go bindings, leading to the resolution of these issues and a pathway
for long-term maintenance and development activities.

## Goals & Objectives

The SIG proposes a charter focused on conservative aims: engaging the
community, solving current and future usability issues, performing on-going
maintenance, and making incremental improvements to the existing codebase
(e.g., functionality, testing, documentation).

More specifically, SIG Go's initial focus will be on the following set of
problems/objectives:

* Fostering community involvement for the project and membership in SIG Go.
* Migrating TensorFlow/Go source code from the main TensorFlow repository to
  a dedicated repository.
* Restoring usability of the bindings, specifically achieving interoperability
  with Go tooling for module installation.
* Improving unit testing and the coverage of tests.
* Improving package documentation, including example code.
* Assessing design and functionality of the package, identifying opportunities
  and developing a roadmap.

## Membership

Anyone involved in or using or contributing to the TensorFlow Go bindings will
be welcome to join the group. To participate, prospective members will be asked
to join SIG Go's mailing list, once established (e.g., at
[go@tensorflow.org](mailto:go@tensorflow.org)).
